The spring of 2021 we had a physics lab project where we in groups of four students had a an objects movement on a track, using the program Tracker.
The purpose of the experiement was to calculate the object's speed, and the uncertainty of the speed estimate. In the included python file you can see
the code for calculating the speed of the object using python and the numpy library.
